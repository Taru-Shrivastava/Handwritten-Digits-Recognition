# Handwritten-Digits-Recognition
 This script builds and trains a neural network using TensorFlow and Keras on the MNIST dataset. It normalizes image data, flattens it, uses a hidden Dense layer with 128 neurons and dropout, and outputs 10 classes with softmax. The model is compiled with Adam, trained for 5 epochs, evaluated, and predicts digit labels, visualizing one prediction
